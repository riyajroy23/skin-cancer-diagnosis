### Diagnosing Skin Cancer with Machine Learning

This project explores machine learning approaches for classifying skin lesion images
from the HAM10000 dataset. The goal is to build and eventually deploy models that can
assist with early skin cancer screening via a web application.

## Project Modules
- **Module 1:** Data exploration, preprocessing, OpenCV image manipulation, and basic ML models
- **Module 2:** Advanced models and web deployment (coming soon)
- **Module 3:** Bias analysis in skin cancer classification
- **Module 4:** Lesion segmentation and advanced computer vision methods

## Dataset
- **HAM10000** skin lesion dataset
- 10,000+ dermoscopic images
- 7 diagnostic classes:
  - Melanocytic nevus
  - Melanoma
  - Benign keratosis
  - Basal cell carcinoma
  - Actinic keratosis
  - Dermatofibroma
  - Vascular lesions

## Techniques Used
- OpenCV image processing
- Data augmentation (flip, blur, zoom)
- KNN and other classical ML models
- ROC-AUC for evaluation on imbalanced data

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
